see description.

usage:
 - device must NOT have been used for development
 - need theos in ./theos
 - update DeveloperDiskImage.{dmg,signature} for your firmware
 - change Makefile to use your dev profile
 - make sure your provisioning profile is installed
 - ./test.sh to build and go.
 - ./interact jailbreak to install cydia, etc
 - reboot if cydia doesn't show up.
 - re-run ./test.sh on each boot to jailbreak again

when jailbroken, only "resigned" binaries will run. that means they have the "platform-application" entitlement.

the "resign" folder is a package that will use dpkg to auto-sign all packages installed. it is very slow.
